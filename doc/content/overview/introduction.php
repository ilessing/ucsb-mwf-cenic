    <p>The UCLA Mobile Web Framework facilitates the development of a robust, 
        feature-rich, cross-platform mobile web presence. Focusing on mobile web
        standards, semantic markup and device agnosticism, the framework enables
        developers to create mobile-styled web applications with relative ease 
        of use.</p>
    <p>The rapidly changing mobile device landscape presents one of the greatest
        challenges for the mobile developer. In the past, developers have had to
        address these differences individually. This has added enormous overhead
        to the development of mobile applications in terms of scope, resources, 
        and budget- both upfront in development and implementation, and later, 
        in maintenance and upgrade cycles. The UCLA Mobile web Framework allows 
        developers (including Universities) to avoid detailed device-by-device 
        planning, implementation, upgrades and maintenance and all their 
        associated costs, and instead makes real the promise of &quot;develop 
        once, use everywhere&quot; by providing a simple abstraction layer 
        whereby the framework itself makes device-by-device determinations 
        freeing the developer to develop.</p>
    <p>The documentation included here covers principals of the framework, 
        tutorials and the API for implementing it in mobile applications, and 
        systems documentation for installing and managing the framework itself.
